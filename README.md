This notification service is a distributed system consisted of an API and a microservice where each service can be developed independently in any language and more importantly scalable on it's own.

This notification system adopts an **asynchronous** communication pattern for internal services communication.
Here's why **asynchronous** is chosen over **synchronous** pattern in this notification system.

**_Synchronous communication_**

Synchronous communication like HTTP works well for small-scale systems, but its shortcomings become obvious as the scale increases. It creates a long request and response cycle that depends on many services. The drawbacks of this approach are:

- Low performance. If any one of the services in the chain doesnâ€™t perform well, the whole system is impacted.

- Tight coupling. The request sender needs to know the recipient.

- Hard to scale. itâ€™s not easy to scale the system to support a sudden increase in traffic.

**_Asynchronous communication_**

Here in asynchronous communication, each request (message) is processed by multiple services. Kafka works well here. When consumers receive messages, they are not removed from Kafka. The same message can be processed by different services. This model maps well to our notification system, as the same request might trigger multiple side effects such as sending push notifications, analytics, etc. An example is illustrated down below.

Generally speaking, synchronous communication is simpler in design, but it doesnâ€™t allow services to be autonomous. Asynchronous communication trades design simplicity and consistency for scalability and failure resilience. For a large-scale system asynchronous communication is a better choice.

And since this is a distributed system communicating asynchronously it uses complimentary design patterns like CQRS, Event-driven architecture and Orchestration.
